#The Disrupted State of My Brain
###Everything is about the change... over and over again.

I still remember quite vividly the day I decided I wanted to become part of the world of digital media production. It was early 1992 and my father had introduced me to a man that had opened a small shop that sold specialized computer hardware for something that he believed was going to change the world... the Video Toaster. I won't get into get into too many specifics regarding the Video Toaster, but the main thing that is relevant to this story is that this product opened a door that altered the course of my life. It was a door that I would walk through many more times as my career took off and one that would take me to places I never imagined, it was a door called _"Disruption"_.    

At that very young stage in my life, disruption was exciting. I felt like I was part of something special. A new world had presented itself to me, and because I had no stake in the world it was leaving behind, it all felt so... _enlightening_. Now the thing that really caught my eye with the Toaster, wasn't the video stuff. There was this cool little animation program that was bundeled with the system called Lightwave 3D. I had ZERO experience with 3D graphics at the time, but I did have a love of illustration. But loving something and being good at something are two different things. I loved to try and draw things, but there was never a point where I thought I was good enough to do it for a living. But, when I was introduced to 3D modeling and animation, something just clicked (no pun intended). I started watching this huge collection of VHS training tapes that showed me all I needed to know about using Lightwave. Then I started spending every moment I could using the software and making things come to life on the screen. I became obsessed. There was a show called Babylon 5 and another called Seaquest DSV that were starting to use Lightwave for their special effects. I would record the shows and then try to recreate the 3D scenes on my own. 

Later that same year I found myself doing flying logo work for a few companies, and before long I was able to quit my full-time job at the local pizza shack and start working as a professional 3D animator. It was a completely unexpected transition. In just under a year my life was totally transformed. This backstory is important to the narrative that follows. It was just the first of many subsequent cycles of discovery, adaptation, and reinvention in my life. Little did I know that the field I was entering was ever-changing. I was going down a rabbit hole, and where that rabbit hole would lead was to yet another rabbit hole.

6 years later I had positioned myself quite comfortably as one of top 3D artists in the area. As it had turned out, what I had become fairly good at were technical animations. A marketing person or training manager would approach me to help design animations of products and processes that where tough to visualize, like the way toner attaches to a piece of paper with the photoelectric effect inside of a copier or the way a laser might cut into a lens during cataracts surgery. I found myself specializing in telling stories that needed to be "translated" from one voice to another. 3D animations were an ideal tool for telling engineering stories to consumers, service technicians, and investors.
